For the guacamole recipe page, we already have done this and determined that we need the following selectors:
h <- read_html("http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/guacamole-recipe-1940609")
recipe <- h %>% html_node(".o-AssetTitle__a-HeadlineText") %>% html_text()
prep_time <- h %>% html_node(".m-RecipeInfo__a-Description--Total") %>% html_text()
ingredients <- h %>% html_nodes(".o-Ingredients__a-Ingredient") %>% html_text()
 create a list
 guacamole <- list(recipe, prep_time, ingredients)
 
 Since recipe pages from this website follow this general layout, we can use this code to create a function that extracts this information
 get_recipe <- function(url){
    h <- read_html(url)
    recipe <- h %>% html_node(".o-AssetTitle__a-HeadlineText") %>% html_text()
    prep_time <- h %>% html_node(".m-RecipeInfo__a-Description--Total") %>% html_text()
    ingredients <- h %>% html_nodes(".o-Ingredients__a-Ingredient") %>% html_text()
    return(list(recipe = recipe, prep_time = prep_time, ingredients = ingredients))
} 
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
h <- read_html(url)
library(rvest)
url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_in_the_United_States_by_state"
h <- read_html(url)
class(h)
h
h <- read_html("http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/guacamole-recipe-1940609")
library(rvest)
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
h <- read_html(url)
url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_in_the_United_States_by_state"
h <- read_html(url)
class(h)
h
h <- read_html("http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/guacamole-recipe-1940609")
get_recipe("http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/pancakes-recipe-1913844")
There are several other powerful tools provided by rvest. For example, the functions html_form(), set_values(), and submit_form() permit you to query a webpage from R. This is a more advanced topic not covered here.
We learned that tables in html are associated with the table node.
list of objects class xml_node
The html_nodes() function returns a list of objects of class xml_node. We can see the content of each one using, for example, the html_text() function. You can see the content for an arbitrarily picked component like this
If the content of this object is an html table, we can use the html_table() function to convert it to a data frame:h<-read_html(url)

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
class(h)
library(rvest)
url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_in_the_United_States_by_state"
h <- read_html(url)


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
