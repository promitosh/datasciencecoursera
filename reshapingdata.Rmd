```

## R Markdown


When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
str(murders)
class(murders)
length("pop")
x<-murders$population
data("murders")
library(dslabs)
install.packages("tidyverse")
data("murders")
head("murders")
str("murders")
data("gapminder")

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
